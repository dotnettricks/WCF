### Calling Cross Domain WCF Service using Jquery
From last couple of days, I was trying to call a wcf service using jquery that is hosted in different domain. But every time I was failed to call wcf service from different domain. After spending much time on R&D, I found the solution and the reason why I was unable to call cross domain wcf service.
